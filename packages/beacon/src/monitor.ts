/**
 * Post-trigger release monitoring. `startRelease` is fire-and-forget at the
 * API level; this module closes the loop: resolve the just-started release's
 * id, then poll it to a terminal state (completed / reverted /
 * monitoring_stopped) and log the outcome.
 *
 * Runs detached from the HTTP request (a guarded release takes as long as its
 * stages say — minutes to days), so the deploy notification responds
 * immediately and monitoring continues in-process. By contract it NEVER
 * throws: a monitoring failure is an observability gap, not a release failure
 * — the release itself proceeds server-side in LaunchDarkly either way.
