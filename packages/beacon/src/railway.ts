/**
 * Railway webhook adapter — translates Railway's deploy webhook payload into
 * the generic deploy notification Beacon acts on.
 *
 * Design: Beacon's front door is the provider-agnostic `/flag-releases`
 * contract; provider adapters like this one are thin translators in front of
 * the same handler, so supporting another CD system means another ~50-line
 * parser, not a Beacon change.
 *
 * Railway payload notes:
 *  - Railway has shipped two webhook generations; this parser accepts both
 *    field layouts (top-level `status` + `service.name` + `deployment.meta.*`,
 *    and variants nesting status/meta differently). Anything else is reported
 *    as `unrecognized` with the top-level keys, never thrown.
 *  - Only a SUCCESSful deploy event triggers releases; other statuses
 *    (BUILDING, DEPLOYING, FAILED, REMOVED…) are acknowledged and ignored.
 *  - The Railway service name must match a key in `config/services.yaml`.
