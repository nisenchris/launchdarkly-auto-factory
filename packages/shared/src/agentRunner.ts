/**
 * Provider-agnostic agent-execution seam.
 *
 * The graph walker dispatches each node through an `AgentRunner`, independent of
 * *which* backend actually runs the agent. Today there are two implementations:
 *
 *   - `VegaAgentRunner`      — LaunchDarkly's hosted Vega agent-dispatch (see
 *                              vegaClient.ts / vegaTransport.ts; unchanged).
 *   - `AnthropicAgentRunner` — runs the graph locally against the Anthropic API,
 *                              using each AI config's instructions as the agent
 *                              system prompt (see ./anthropic/).
 *
 * Selection is a runtime decision driven by the `auto-factory-ai-provider`
 * LaunchDarkly flag (see providerFlag.ts). The neutral types below are
 * structurally compatible with the Vega result shape so the Vega path is a thin
 * adapter and the walker code is identical for every provider.
