# LaunchDarkly AutoFactory — Cursor/VS Code extension

Phase 1 of AutoFactory, run from the editor instead of (or alongside) the
GitHub Action. On your current changes it runs the same five-agent chain:
research and classify, create a feature flag (off), wire the code, create
guarded-release metrics and instrument their events, and write flag-on/flag-off
tests, then surface the reviewer's verdict.

The agents' edits land in your **working tree, uncommitted** — you review them
in the editor's SCM panel and commit yourself. Nothing is pushed.

## How it relates to the GitHub Action

Both front ends share one core (`@auto-factory/shared`: graph walk, agents,
tools, approval). They differ only at the edges:

| | GitHub Action | This extension |
|---|---|---|
| Trigger | PR opened/updated | Button, command, or a new commit on a feature branch |
| Change set | PR diff (base…head) | Working tree vs the base branch |
| Agent edits | committed + pushed to the PR | left in the working tree for review |
| Output | PR comment | output log + sidebar view + notification |

The Action is unaffected by this package; it is a separate, peer front end.

## Model access (current limitation)

The chain currently runs on a **direct Anthropic API call** using its own
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (the same local runner the GitHub Action uses). It does not
route through Cursor's own model access.

The intended design is to use the editor's models instead of a separate key,
via the VS Code Language Model API (`vscode.lm`). That is **blocked on Cursor**:
Cursor does not implement `vscode.lm` for extensions yet, so
`selectChatModels()` returns no models there (it works in stock VS Code via
Copilot). This is an open Cursor feature request. Until Cursor ships it, the
extension needs its own Anthropic key. When Cursor adds `vscode.lm`, the
`AgentRunner` seam in `@auto-factory/shared` lets us drop in an editor-models
runner without touching the chain.

## Triggers

- **Button:** the rocket in the **AutoFactory** sidebar, the status-bar item, or
  the Source Control title bar.
- **Command:** `LaunchDarkly AutoFactory: Run on Current Changes`.
- **Automatic** (`launchdarkly-autofactory.autoRun`): on a new commit to a
  non-base branch — `off`, `prompt` (default; offers a notification), or `auto`.

## Configuration

Non-secret options are in Settings (`launchdarkly-autofactory.*`): factory and
app project keys, base URL, graph key, base branch, approval mode, the
flag-creation / code-changes toggles, and the auto-run mode.

API keys are stored in the editor's SecretStorage, never in settings.json. Run
**`LaunchDarkly AutoFactory: Set API Keys`** to enter them:

- LaunchDarkly server SDK key (`sdk-…`) for the factory project
- LaunchDarkly API token (`api-…`) — needed to create flags/metrics
- Anthropic API key

(If the editor was launched from a shell that already exports `LD_SDK_KEY` /
`LD_API_KEY` / `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, those are used as a fallback.)

## Running it from source

This is a prototype; it is not published to a marketplace. From the monorepo
root:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run bundle -w launchdarkly-autofactory   # produces dist/extension.bundle.cjs
```

Then either:

- **Develop with F5:** open `packages/phase1-cursor-extension/` in Cursor/VS
  Code and create `.vscode/launch.json`:

  ```json
  {
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
      {
        "name": "Run AutoFactory Extension",
        "type": "extensionHost",
        "request": "launch",
        "args": ["--extensionDevelopmentPath=${workspaceFolder}"]
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

  Press F5; in the Extension Development Host window, open a git repo, set the
  API keys, and run.

- **Package a VSIX:** `npx @vscode/vsce package` in this directory, then install
  the `.vsix` via the Extensions view → "Install from VSIX…".

## What a run does

1. Builds the change context from the working tree (branch, last commit, repo).
2. Resolves the agent graph + agent instructions from LaunchDarkly (same configs
   the Action uses).
3. Walks the chain with the local Anthropic runner; `git_diff` reports the
   working tree vs the base branch, so each agent sees the prior agents'
   uncommitted edits.
4. Writes flag wiring, metric instrumentation, the release manifest
   (`.release-flags/…`), and tests into the working tree.
5. Shows the reviewer's verdict and risk. The approval mode is advisory here:
   the edits are already in your tree, so you decide what to commit.
