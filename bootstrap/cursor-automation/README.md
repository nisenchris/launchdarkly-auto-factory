# AutoFactory Phase 1 as a native Cursor automation (prototype)

A third front end for Phase 1, alongside the GitHub Action
(`packages/phase1-resource-factory`) and the VS Code extension
(`packages/phase1-cursor-extension`). Instead of running our own agent loop, this
runs the chain inside **Cursor's native agent**, so it uses Cursor's own model
subscription. There is no Anthropic API key, which is the point: Cursor does not
expose its models to extensions, but it does run them in its own agent.

Run it two ways: **locally and by hand** (the `/autofactory` command — edits land
in your working tree for review) or as a **cloud Automation** (a GitHub trigger
fires a cloud sandbox that opens a PR). Both share the same artifacts; see
[Run as a cloud Automation](#run-as-a-cloud-automation).

It is kept separate from the extension and the TypeScript packages on purpose:
these are just editor config artifacts (`.cursor/` rules, a command, and an MCP
config), not compiled code.

## How it works

A bootstrap rule (`rules/autofactory.mdc`) owns the sequencing, the LaunchDarkly
conventions, and a tool-translation table. The five agents' detailed
instructions stay in LaunchDarkly (the source of truth); the rule has the agent
**fetch each phase's instructions at run time** via the LaunchDarkly MCP
`get-ai-config` tool, then carry them out with Cursor's native tools.

The translation matters: the LaunchDarkly instructions name tools from our other
runtimes (`create_flag`, `create_metric`, `commit_and_push`, ...). The rule maps
each to a native equivalent:

- `create_flag` to the LaunchDarkly MCP `create-feature-flag` tool
- `create_metric` to the LaunchDarkly MCP metric-creation tool
- file edits, `git diff`, tests to Cursor's native file/terminal tools
- `commit_and_push` to nothing: edits are left in the working tree for you

## Layout

```
bootstrap/cursor-automation/
  README.md
  dot-cursor/                      # rename or merge into a target repo's .cursor/
    rules/autofactory.mdc          # bootstrap rule: sequencing + tool translation + conventions
    commands/autofactory.md        # the /autofactory manual command
    environment.json               # cloud-sandbox setup (install deps)
    mcp.json                       # LaunchDarkly MCP server config (add your api key)
```

## Prerequisites

- Cursor, and Node (the LaunchDarkly MCP server runs via `npx`).
- A LaunchDarkly API access token (`api-...`) with access to **both** projects:
  the factory project that holds the agent configs (`auto-factory-prototype`,
  read via `get-ai-config`) and the app project where flags and metrics are
  created (`autofactory-demo`).

## Install into a target app repo

1. Copy `dot-cursor/` into the target repo as `.cursor/` (or merge its contents
   into an existing `.cursor/`).
2. In `.cursor/mcp.json`, replace `REPLACE_WITH_LD_API_KEY` with your token. Do
   not commit a real token. Then enable the **LaunchDarkly** MCP server in
   Cursor settings.
3. If your project keys differ from the defaults, edit them in
   `rules/autofactory.mdc` (factory and app project keys).

## Run

1. On a feature branch in the target repo, make a normal change (no flag).
2. In Cursor, run the `/autofactory` command (or ask the agent to "run
   AutoFactory on my changes" and `@autofactory`).
3. The agent goes through research, flag, metrics, tests, and review, fetching
   each phase's instructions from LaunchDarkly. It creates the flag and metrics
   (both via the MCP server) in the app project, writes the
   `.release-flags/...json` manifest, adds flag-on/flag-off tests, and reports a
   verdict.
4. Review the edits in Cursor's Source Control panel and commit them yourself.
   Nothing is committed or pushed for you.

## Run as a cloud Automation

The same artifacts also back a **cloud** Cursor Automation: a GitHub trigger
fires a cloud sandbox that clones the repo, runs the chain, and opens a PR — no
local Cursor session, no manual command. The chain, the `@autofactory` rule, and
the LaunchDarkly-hosted instructions are identical; only the trigger, the MCP
wiring, and the output (a PR instead of working-tree edits) differ.

Setup, once the `dot-cursor/` artifacts are in your target app repo on GitHub:

1. **Environment.** `dot-cursor/environment.json` installs the app's deps so the
   Tests phase can run. Adjust its `install` command to your repo's layout (the
   shipped one matches the demo app: a Node `frontend/` + a Python `backend/`).
2. **MCP.** Connect the LaunchDarkly MCP server in the MCP dropdown at
   cursor.com/agents (cloud agents configure MCP in the web, not from the repo's
   `.cursor/mcp.json`). The flag and metric tools come from this server, so no
   `LD_API_KEY` secret or REST fallback is needed in the cloud path.
3. **Automation.** Create an automation (cursor.com/automations or `/automate`)
   with trigger *Pull request opened*, the prompt from
   [`cloud-automation-prompt.md`](cloud-automation-prompt.md), and the
   **LaunchDarkly MCP** + **Open PR** + **Comment on PR** tools enabled.

The prompt carries a loop guard (skip if the change set already has a
`.release-flags/` manifest) because the PR the automation opens would otherwise
re-fire the "pull request opened" trigger.

## Limitations (prototype)

- **Two ways to run.** The local `/autofactory` command (above) leaves edits in
  your working tree; the cloud Automation opens a PR. Both share these artifacts.
- **Approval is advisory.** The reviewer's verdict is reported, not enforced
  (the edits are already in your tree). Hook-based gating is a later option.
- **Fetch-and-obey reliability** is exactly what this prototype tests: whether an
  agent reliably pulls each phase's instructions from LaunchDarkly and follows
  them. If it proves flaky, the fallback is to bake the five prompt bodies into
  `.cursor/rules/` (synced from `config/agentcontrol/ai-configs/`).
- **No LaunchDarkly agent-generation metrics.** Cursor's runtime does not emit
  the per-agent token/duration tracking the Node runtimes do.

## Relation to the other front ends

Same Phase 1 chain, same LaunchDarkly-hosted instructions, same release-manifest
handoff to Phase 2. The Action commits to a PR in CI; the extension edits your
working tree using a direct Anthropic key; this path edits your working tree
using Cursor's own models. None of them depend on each other.
