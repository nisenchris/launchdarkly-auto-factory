# AutoFactory Agent Config & Graph — Change Log

Running log of changes to the AutoFactory **AI configs** (`autofactory-*`) and the
**agent graph** (`gha-auto-factory`). These resources live in LaunchDarkly (the
factory / control-plane project `auto-factory-prototype`), not as files in this
repo — this file is the human-readable record of what changed there and why.

## 2026-06-09

### ✅ 1. Added the Metrics Author agent + rewired the graph
- **Change:** Added `autofactory-metrics-author` as a core node in the chain and
  rewired `gha-auto-factory` to:
  `research-planner → flag-implementer → metrics-author → flag-testing → code-reviewer`.
- **Handoff conditions:** flag-implementer → metrics-author requires `flag_created=true`;
  metrics-author → flag-testing requires `needs_tests=true`.
- **Why:** The release pipeline needs metrics authored for guarded releases; the
  metrics step belongs between flag creation and testing.

### ✅ 2. Increased the Code Reviewer turn budget
- **Change:** Raised `max_turns` on the `flag-testing → code-reviewer` edge handoff
  to **30** (verified live).
- **Note:** An earlier attempt to set this to 25 did **not** persist — the live
  graph was still 15 when checked on 2026-06-09, which is why the reviewer kept
  running out of turns. Now confirmed at 30 via full-object REST PATCH.
- **Why:** The reviewer was hitting its turn cap before reaching a verdict. (Turns
  are a cushion; the real cause was the reviewer being unable to see the diff —
  see #4.)

### ✅ 3. Test agent (`autofactory-flag-testing`) — de-scoped + execute (v2)
- **Changes applied** (variation `default` → version 2):
  1. **Explicit execution:** "generate tests" → "use `write_file`/`edit_file` to
     create the test file(s), then `commit_and_push` once. Do NOT merely
     describe/design the tests."
  2. **De-scoped to flagged behavior only:** removed ROLE 1 (general coverage for
     all modified production code — rules T03/T04/T21–T25 and skip-conditions
     T14/T15). The agent now writes ONLY flag-on/flag-off tests for the code paths
     the flag-implementer wrapped (rules T01/T02/T08/T12/T13).
  3. **(Extra) Repo-adaptive test conventions:** replaced the hardcoded gonfalon
     Go/TypeScript patterns (`testify`, `@gonfalon/testing`, Vitest, the
     `T26/T27` framework constraints, `/app/run_validation.sh`) with "detect and
     follow the repo's existing framework; else the language's standard (e.g.
     pytest for Python)." Needed because the demo app is Python/Flask — the
     gonfalon-only patterns would have produced Go/TS tests for Python code.
- **Why:** The agent has write + push tools now (PR
  launchdarkly-labs/launchdarkly-auto-factory#1, merged), but on demo PR #3 it
  described tests instead of creating them, and its scope/patterns were wrong for
  the target repo.
- **Follow-up (version 4):** switched its diff reference to the new `git_diff` tool
  (it has no shell) and reworded "Validation" to acknowledge it cannot execute
  tests (no bash) — verify test files are syntactically valid instead.

### ✅ 4. Code Reviewer (`autofactory-code-reviewer`) — let it SEE the diff (v2)
- **Root cause (not turns):** the reviewer was told to run `gh pr diff` / use
  `Bash`, but in our runtime it has **no shell, bash, or gh** — only read-only file
  tools. So it couldn't see the change set and burned all its turns reading files
  one-by-one to infer the diff, never reaching a verdict.
- **Changes applied** (variation `default` → version 2):
  1. Added a read-only **`git_diff`** tool to the agent runtime (shared sandbox
     tools; available to all nodes). Wired `pr_base` through the action/workflow so
     it diffs `base...HEAD`.
  2. Reviewer instructions: call **`git_diff` FIRST** to see the full change set
     (incl. agent enrichment commits), then read specific files. Aligned tool names
     (`Read`/`Glob`/`Bash`/`gh pr diff` → `read_file`/`list_dir`/`grep`/`git_diff`)
     and stated it has no shell access.
  3. Verdict stays **last** (step 5): analyze, then emit `review_approved` /
     `risk_level`. (We explicitly did NOT adopt "verdict first" — a verdict should
     follow the analysis, not precede it.)
- **Why:** Treat the cause (can't see the diff), not the symptom (turn cap). Turns
  raised to 30 (see #2) as a secondary cushion.
- **Validated:** demo PR #4 (`/api/quote`) — reviewer ran to completion, called
  `git_diff`, and returned an accurate verdict (REJECT, 2 BLOCKING) catching a real
  test/impl mismatch. See #5.

### ✅ 5. Flag Implementer (`autofactory-flag-implementer`) — fail-safe eval + tool-accurate (v2)
- **Primary change (Task #3):** flag evaluation must FAIL SAFE — any error from the
  flag-eval client falls back to the control/default variation (try/except in
  Python, handle the error return in Go, catch in TS); harden the shared eval
  helper if it lacks this. Keeps the implementation consistent with the testing
  agent's resilience tests (the gap the reviewer caught on PR #4: the test asserted
  graceful degradation that `_flag()` didn't implement).
- **Incidental cleanup (made in the same edit):**
  - Removed the gonfalon-specific SDK-helper patterns (`createFlagFunction` /
    `@gonfalon/dogfood-flags`, `flagfn.NewBool` / `OnErrorLogAsError`), the
    `make go-generate` "Code Generation" section, and the `/app/run_validation.sh`
    "Validation" step — none apply in this runtime. Replaced with "match the repo's
    existing flag pattern."
  - Swapped `ldcli flags create` → the in-runtime `create_flag` tool, and push →
    `commit_and_push`. NOTE: `ldcli` is LaunchDarkly's official CLI (not gonfalon) —
    this was a swap to our current tool, not a "fix." See backlog below.

### ✅ 6. `run_tests` tool — testing agent runs what it writes (testing v5)
- **Change:** Added a `run_tests` agent tool (auto-detects pytest / `npm test` / `go test`,
  installs deps, returns pass/fail output), available to the edit-capable nodes. Testing
  agent → **version 5**: write tests → `run_tests` → fix failures (imports, fixtures,
  assertions) → only `commit_and_push` once green. Added guidance to ensure imports
  resolve for how the runner is invoked (module path / `conftest.py`).
- **Why:** The testing agent wrote tests it couldn't execute (no shell), so import/path
  errors slipped through on every run and the reviewer (correctly) blocked them — PR #4
  (test/impl fail-safe mismatch) and PR #5 (`from app import …` module-path error). Same
  shape as the `git_diff` fix: give the agent the ability to verify its own output. This
  is real code execution in the CI sandbox — the capability expansion we'd deliberately
  deferred until now.

### 🔜 Backlog — consider `ldcli` for flag creation
- Today the implementer creates flags via the REST-backed `create_flag` tool. Using
  LaunchDarkly's official CLI (`ldcli`) may be more efficient/idiomatic long-term.
  Revisit once the core chain is stable. (https://launchdarkly.com/docs/home/getting-started/ldcli)
