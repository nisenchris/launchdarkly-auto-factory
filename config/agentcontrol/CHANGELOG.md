# AutoFactory Agent Config & Graph — Change Log

Running log of changes to the AutoFactory **AI configs** (`autofactory-*`), the
**agent graph** (`gha-auto-factory`), and the **operational flags** that drive the
pipeline. These resources live in LaunchDarkly (the factory / control-plane project
`auto-factory-prototype`), not as files in this repo — this file is the
human-readable record of what changed there and why.

> Out of scope: agent *runtime* changes (the action's tools — `git_diff`,
> `create_flag`, `write_file`/`edit_file`/`run_tests`/`commit_and_push` — and the
> approval logic) live in the code repo / its PRs. They're referenced here only
> where they explain a config change.

### ✅ Per-step approval gates (`auto-factory-approval-gates` flag)
- **New operational flag** in the factory project: `auto-factory-approval-gates`,
  a **JSON flag** whose value is an array of agent node keys (e.g.
  `["autofactory-flag-implementer"]`). The chain pauses BEFORE each listed
  agent until a human approves. Default `[]` = no gates (current behavior).
  Read natively via the SDK (same pattern as `auto-factory-ai-provider`).
- **Independent of `APPROVAL_MODE`.** `APPROVAL_MODE` still governs whether the
  FINISHED chain auto-applies; gates pause MID-chain (before a step's side
  effects). The original ask — approve after research, before flag creation —
  is `["autofactory-flag-implementer"]`.
- **How approval is given:**
  - **GitHub Action:** the run halts and comments which PR label to add
    (`af-approve:<nodeKey>`); adding it re-triggers the workflow (template now
    includes the `labeled` event) and the re-run proceeds. Approval persists
    across pushes. A pending gate is a red check (action required).
  - **Cursor extension:** an interactive Approve/Stop modal blocks the in-process
    run at each gate.
- Code: `packages/shared/src/approvalGates.ts` + a `GateController` hook in the
  walker; `packages/phase1-resource-factory/src/labels.ts` for the GHA labels.

### ✅ Operational flags now bootstrap-provisioned (off by default)
- **Change:** the two operational flags (`auto-factory-ai-provider`,
  `auto-factory-approval-gates`) now have committed definitions under
  `config/agentcontrol/flags/`, and `config-bridge provision`/`seed` (hence
  `npm run bootstrap`) create them in the factory project alongside the AI
  configs + graph. Previously only AI configs + graphs were provisioned, so a
  fresh consumer project had no operational flags until created by hand.
- **Safe by default:** each is provisioned **off** — provider serves `anthropic`,
  gates serve `[]` (no gates) — so behavior is unchanged until a maintainer flips
  it. Provisioning is idempotent and 404-tolerant: an existing flag (and its
  targeting) is never overwritten.
- Code: `packages/config-bridge/src/provision.ts` (`provisionFlag`, `flagsDir`),
  `config/agentcontrol/flags/*.json`.

## 2026-06-22

### ✅ Tag registry as source of truth (issue #9 item #5)
- **Change:** added `config/agentcontrol/tags.json` — the machine-readable
  registry of every routing/verdict tag (producer, `llm` vs `tool` production,
  the graph edges that consume it, and whether approval/manifest reads it).
- **Guard upgrade:** `check-configs` now validates against the registry exactly
  instead of a token heuristic — bidirectional graph⟷registry edge checks,
  producer verification (an `llm` tag must appear in its agent's instructions; a
  `tool` tag must be in the write-tool auto-set), and a README-table⟷registry
  equality check.
- **Resolved a real drift it surfaced:** `flag_worthy` was emitted by the
  research planner and forced by the runner, but consumed by no edge and absent
  from the README table. Documented it as **advisory** (recorded but not routed
  on) in both the registry and the README "Canonical agent tags" table. Also
  fixed a stale `approval.ts` path in the README (moved to `packages/shared`).

### ✅ Fixed invalid `tag_conversation` signature in committed configs + added a routing-contract guard
- **Problem (issue #9, failure mode #1):** `autofactory-metrics-author` and
  `autofactory-research-planner` instructed the model to call
  `tag_conversation(key="…", value="…")`, but the tool only accepts a single
  `tags` object (`{"tags": {"k": "v"}}`). With the wrong signature the model
  emits no tags, so the chain stalls and reports a misleading verdict.
- **Fix:** rewrote the 5 affected calls to the valid form
  `tag_conversation({"tags": {"…": "…"}})` (metrics-author: metrics_created /
  metric_keys / needs_tests; research-planner: flag_worthy / skip_flagging).
  These are the committed seed copies; re-sync the live LD configs to match if
  they still carry the old form.
- **Guard:** new `npm run check:configs` (`scripts/check-configs.mjs`, wired
  into CI + a test) lints for the invalid signature and checks that every graph
  edge's `require_tags`/`skip_if_tags` is producible by some agent or write
  tool — so this class of routing-contract drift fails fast. Addresses issue #9
  item #2; the runtime forced-tag-call (item #1) is the next step.

## 2026-06-11

### ✅ Committed the canonical public copies of all five agent configs
- **Change:** exported each `autofactory-*` config's `default` (Anthropic) variation
  from the live project into `config/agentcontrol/ai-configs/*.json` (provision
  format). Versions at export: planner v2, implementer v4, metrics-author v5,
  testing v5, reviewer v3. Vega variations stay live-only (internal runtime details).
- **Why:** external consumers provision from these files (`npm run bootstrap`);
  the directory was intentionally empty before (old I3). Convention going forward:
  edit in LD → re-export here → log in this changelog.

### ✅ Code reviewer: metric-key vs event-key convention (false-positive REJECT fix)
- **Problem:** on demo PR #10 the reviewer REJECTED (risk high) because the code's
  `track()` events (`enable-haiku-endpoint-error`) didn't string-match the metric
  KEYS (`enable-haiku-endpoint-error-rate`) — but that difference is the designed
  convention; the metric's `event_key` field is the link, and the Metrics Author's
  brief showed the correct pairing.
- **Change (`autofactory-code-reviewer` `default` v3):** added a "Metric keys vs.
  event keys (do NOT flag this as a mismatch)" section — validate `track()` events
  against each metric's `event_key`, never against metric keys; flag only events
  matching NO metric. Also added the Metrics Author to R09 (fail-safe telemetry,
  event/metric linkage) and to the `agent` attribution enum.

## 2026-06-10

### ✅ Metrics-author tag convention: `flag:<flag-key>` → `flag-<flag-key>`
- **Change:** Updated BOTH `autofactory-metrics-author` variations (`default` and the
  preserved "Vega Chain" copy): the flag-reference tag convention is now
  `flag-<flag-key>` with an explicit "LaunchDarkly tags cannot contain `:`" note.
- **Why:** observed on demo PR #9 — the instructions said `flag:enable-...` but the
  metric landed with `flag-enable-color-endpoint` because LD tag validation rejects
  colons. The convention now matches what actually gets stored, so the future metric
  cleanup job can rely on a mechanical prefix scan. Repo-side, the `ldWriter` test's
  example tag was aligned to the valid form.

### ✅ Synced the live `gha-auto-factory` graph with the committed copy (capabilities now live)
- **Change:** Full-object REST PATCH of the live graph: added the `capabilities`
  grants to three edges (→flag-implementer `["create_flag","edit_files"]`,
  →metrics-author `["create_metric","edit_files"]`, →flag-testing `["edit_files"]`)
  and removed the inert `prompt_template` from every edge (completes CLEANUP #28 on
  the live side). Kept the live `max_turns` values.
- **Why this matters:** the action resolves the graph **live** via the AI SDK's
  `agentGraph()` — the committed `graphs/auto-factory.json` is a record, not the
  runtime source. Until this PATCH, the edge grants only existed in the committed
  copy and the runner was riding on its hardcoded `NODE_CAPABILITIES` fallback.
- **Reconciliation:** the committed copy's testing→code-reviewer `max_turns` was 15
  while live ran 30; updated the committed file to 30 so the record matches reality.

### ✅ Rewrote the live `autofactory-research-planner` instructions for the Anthropic tool surface
- **Change:** Replaced the `default` variation's instructions (now v2). The Vega-era
  original is preserved as the `default-configuration-copy` variation (see the
  variation-pattern entry below).
- **What changed:** tool references fixed (`git_diff`/`read_file`/`list_dir`/`grep`
  instead of `Read`/`Glob`/`Bash` + `gh pr diff`); dropped the four interpolation
  variables the action never supplies (`FILES_CHANGED_COUNT`, `LINES_CHANGED`,
  `CHANGED_FILES_SUMMARY`, `CI_CONTEXT`) — `git_diff` is the changed-files source now;
  replaced the internal-monorepo "Repo Structure Reference" (and `flagfn.NewBool` /
  `createFlagFunction` patterns) with repo-agnostic detect-from-the-code guidance;
  added an explicit Chain Routing Tags section (`flag_worthy`, and `skip_flagging`
  documented as a chain short-circuit — the old text wrongly said the planner's output
  was "NOT a routing decision").
- **Kept:** the two-phase research → brief structure, classification taxonomy, and the
  flag/test/review brief fields downstream agents parse.

### ✅ Pattern: per-provider variations on each AI config
- **Decision:** each `autofactory-*` config keeps its **`default` variation as the
  Anthropic-surface instructions** (the current primary path) and a separate
  **Vega-surface variation** (e.g. "Vega Chain" / "Default Configuration - Copy")
  preserving the Bash/MCP-tooling instructions. Later, targeting can serve the right
  variation off the `auto-factory-ai-provider` flag so instructions switch with the
  execution backend. No targeting changes yet — Anthropic stays the served default.

### ✅ Rewrote the live `autofactory-metrics-author` instructions for the Anthropic tool surface
- **Change:** Replaced the `default` variation's instructions (now v2, renamed
  "Vega Chain" → "Default Configuration"). This is the "separate config update
  entry" promised by the 2026-06-09 `create_metric` code entry below.
- **What changed in the instructions:**
  - Dropped the Vega Environment section (clone-the-repo, `/workspace`, git identity)
    — the Anthropic runner operates in the pre-checked-out PR branch.
  - Tool surface is now the real sandbox set: `read_file`/`list_dir`/`grep`/`git_diff`/
    `tag_conversation` + granted `create_metric`/`edit_file`/`write_file`/`run_tests`/
    `commit_and_push`. No Bash/curl REST payloads (the `create_metric` tool owns the
    category → LD metric-shape mapping), no LD/observability MCP tools.
  - Reuse-first (M02/M07) reworded for what the agent can actually see: code-level
    reuse (existing `track()` events on the flagged path) + `create_metric`
    idempotency, instead of `launchdarkly_list_metrics` / trace queries.
  - Kept: guarded-release framing, M-rules, the three categories, killswitch/pause/
    monitoring classification, naming convention, manifest loop-closure
    (`releaseOverrides.metricKeys` + `randomizationUnit`), chain output + routing tags.
  - New: latency events must pass elapsed ms as the `track()` metric value; M01 skip
    now explicitly tags `metrics_created=false` + `needs_tests=true`; notes that
    `create_metric` auto-sets `metrics_created`/`metric_keys`.
- **Why:** the old instructions were written for the Vega runtime; on the Anthropic
  provider the agent degraded to a markdown spec (demo PR #8). Pairs with the
  `create_metric` capability + graph-edge grant in the entry below.

## 2026-06-09

### ✅ Metrics Author can now actually create metrics on the Anthropic path
- **Problem:** the metrics-author's instructions were written for the Vega runtime
  (Bash + curl to the metrics REST API + observability/LD MCP tools). On the default
  **Anthropic** provider it had none of those — no metric-creation tool and no
  `edit_files` grant — so it degraded to writing a markdown spec and tagged
  `metrics_created=false`. (Confirmed on demo PR #8.)
- **Code (tooling repo):** added a `create_metric` agent tool + `LdResourceWriter.createMetric`
  (maps category error/latency/business → LD metric fields; idempotent on 409) and a
  new `create_metric` capability.
- **Graph:** the edge into `autofactory-metrics-author` now grants
  `capabilities: ["create_metric", "edit_files"]` (so it can instrument a `track()`
  event AND create the metric off it). Fallback `NODE_CAPABILITIES` also updated.
- **Instructions:** the live `autofactory-metrics-author` config must be rewritten to
  the Anthropic tool surface (`create_metric` / `edit_file` / `read_file`) instead of
  Bash/curl/MCP — see the separate config update entry.

### ✅ (cleanup) Dropped inert `prompt_template` from the committed graph copy
- **Change:** Removed `"prompt_template": "{{PR_NUMBER}}"` from every edge of the
  committed `graphs/auto-factory.json`. The graph walker owns prompt construction
  for **every** provider (it never forwards `prompt_template` to Vega), so the field
  was inert. Documented the handoff fields the walker DOES honor (`require_tags`,
  `skip_if_tags`, `max_turns`, `request_type`) in this directory's README.
- **Note:** this only touched the committed local copy. The live LD graph may still
  carry the field; it's harmless (inert) but can be removed there too. See CLEANUP #28.

### ✅ (cleanup) Edge-declared agent `capabilities` (config-driven write access)
- **Change:** Added a `capabilities` array to two edges of the committed
  `graphs/auto-factory.json`: the edge into `autofactory-flag-implementer` grants
  `["create_flag", "edit_files"]`, the edge into `autofactory-flag-testing` grants
  `["edit_files"]`. The Anthropic runner reads these instead of a hardcoded
  config-key map (which it keeps only as a fallback). Always intersected with the
  global `ENABLE_FLAG_CREATION` / `ENABLE_CODE_CHANGES` toggles.
- **Why:** "which agent can write" should be config, not code — a renamed/added
  agent no longer silently lands read-only. See CLEANUP #24. To take effect on the
  Vega-seeded path, add the same `capabilities` to the live LD graph's edges.

### ✅ 0. Provider-selection flag (`auto-factory-ai-provider`) — foundational
- **Change:** Created a multivariate string flag in the factory project: variations
  `anthropic` / `vega` (extensible to other providers), **default `anthropic`**.
- **What it does:** the Phase 1 runtime evaluates it (server SDK) to pick the agent
  execution backend — run the chain locally on the Anthropic API, or dispatch to Vega.
  Flip it in LaunchDarkly to switch; no code/workflow change needed.
- **Why:** decouples "which AI runs the agents" from the pipeline so we can move off
  Vega without losing it, and swap providers later.

### ✅ 1. Added the Metrics Author agent + rewired the graph
- **Change:** Added `autofactory-metrics-author` as a core node in the chain and
  rewired `gha-auto-factory` to:
  `research-planner → flag-implementer → metrics-author → flag-testing → code-reviewer`.
- **Handoff conditions:** flag-implementer → metrics-author requires `flag_created=true`;
  metrics-author → flag-testing requires `needs_tests=true`.
- **Why:** The release pipeline needs metrics authored for guarded releases; the
  metrics step belongs between flag creation and testing.

### ✅ 2. Increased the Code Reviewer turn budget
- **Change:** Raised `max_turns` on the `flag-testing → code-reviewer` edge handoff
  to **30** (verified live).
- **Note:** An earlier attempt to set this to 25 did **not** persist — the live
  graph was still 15 when checked on 2026-06-09, which is why the reviewer kept
  running out of turns. Now confirmed at 30 via full-object REST PATCH.
- **Why:** The reviewer was hitting its turn cap before reaching a verdict. (Turns
  are a cushion; the real cause was the reviewer being unable to see the diff —
  see #4.)

### ✅ 3. Test agent (`autofactory-flag-testing`) — de-scoped + execute (v2)
- **Changes applied** (variation `default` → version 2):
  1. **Explicit execution:** "generate tests" → "use `write_file`/`edit_file` to
     create the test file(s), then `commit_and_push` once. Do NOT merely
     describe/design the tests."
  2. **De-scoped to flagged behavior only:** removed ROLE 1 (general coverage for
     all modified production code — rules T03/T04/T21–T25 and skip-conditions
     T14/T15). The agent now writes ONLY flag-on/flag-off tests for the code paths
     the flag-implementer wrapped (rules T01/T02/T08/T12/T13).
  3. **(Extra) Repo-adaptive test conventions:** replaced the hardcoded internal-monorepo
     Go/TypeScript patterns (`testify`, `@internal/testing`, Vitest, the
     `T26/T27` framework constraints, `/app/run_validation.sh`) with "detect and
     follow the repo's existing framework; else the language's standard (e.g.
     pytest for Python)." Needed because the demo app is Python/Flask — the
     internal-monorepo-only patterns would have produced Go/TS tests for Python code.
- **Why:** The agent has write + push tools now (PR
  launchdarkly-labs/launchdarkly-auto-factory#1, merged), but on demo PR #3 it
  described tests instead of creating them, and its scope/patterns were wrong for
  the target repo.
- **Follow-up (version 4):** switched its diff reference to the new `git_diff` tool
  (it has no shell) and reworded "Validation" to acknowledge it cannot execute
  tests (no bash) — verify test files are syntactically valid instead.

### ✅ 4. Code Reviewer (`autofactory-code-reviewer`) — let it SEE the diff (v2)
- **Root cause (not turns):** the reviewer was told to run `gh pr diff` / use
  `Bash`, but in our runtime it has **no shell, bash, or gh** — only read-only file
  tools. So it couldn't see the change set and burned all its turns reading files
  one-by-one to infer the diff, never reaching a verdict.
- **Changes applied** (variation `default` → version 2):
  1. Added a read-only **`git_diff`** tool to the agent runtime (shared sandbox
     tools; available to all nodes). Wired `pr_base` through the action/workflow so
     it diffs `base...HEAD`.
  2. Reviewer instructions: call **`git_diff` FIRST** to see the full change set
     (incl. agent enrichment commits), then read specific files. Aligned tool names
     (`Read`/`Glob`/`Bash`/`gh pr diff` → `read_file`/`list_dir`/`grep`/`git_diff`)
     and stated it has no shell access.
  3. Verdict stays **last** (step 5): analyze, then emit `review_approved` /
     `risk_level`. (We explicitly did NOT adopt "verdict first" — a verdict should
     follow the analysis, not precede it.)
- **Why:** Treat the cause (can't see the diff), not the symptom (turn cap). Turns
  raised to 30 (see #2) as a secondary cushion.
- **Validated:** demo PR #4 (`/api/quote`) — reviewer ran to completion, called
  `git_diff`, and returned an accurate verdict (REJECT, 2 BLOCKING) catching a real
  test/impl mismatch. See #5.

### ✅ 5. Flag Implementer (`autofactory-flag-implementer`) — tool-accurate cleanup (v2), fail-safe reverted (v3)
- **Tool/pattern cleanup (v2, still in effect):**
  - Removed the internal-monorepo-specific SDK-helper patterns (`createFlagFunction` /
    `@internal/dogfood-flags`, `flagfn.NewBool` / `OnErrorLogAsError`), the
    `make go-generate` "Code Generation" section, and the `/app/run_validation.sh`
    "Validation" step — none apply in this runtime. Replaced with "match the repo's
    existing flag pattern."
  - Swapped `ldcli flags create` → the in-runtime `create_flag` tool, and push →
    `commit_and_push`. NOTE: `ldcli` is LaunchDarkly's official CLI (not an internal tool) —
    this was a swap to our current tool, not a "fix." See backlog below.
- **Fail-safe Task #3 — ADDED in v2, then REVERTED in v3 (decision "(a)"):** v2 had
  added "flag evaluation must FAIL SAFE … harden the shared helper" to keep the code
  consistent with the testing agent's resilience tests. We reverted it because:
  (1) LaunchDarkly's server SDK `variation()` is **already fail-safe by design**
  (returns the default on error, doesn't throw), so the PR #4 resilience test was
  over-specified; (2) the implementer wasn't honoring the instruction anyway (PR #5/#7
  left `_flag()` unhardened). We rely on the SDK's built-in fail-safe rather than imply
  defensive behavior we don't enforce. The testing agent only writes flag-on/flag-off
  tests now, so there's no test/impl conflict to reconcile. Current Task #3 is just
  "preserve existing behavior on the control path."

### ✅ 6. `run_tests` tool — testing agent runs what it writes (testing v5)
- **Change:** Added a `run_tests` agent tool (auto-detects pytest / `npm test` / `go test`,
  installs deps, returns pass/fail output), available to the edit-capable nodes. Testing
  agent → **version 5**: write tests → `run_tests` → fix failures (imports, fixtures,
  assertions) → only `commit_and_push` once green. Added guidance to ensure imports
  resolve for how the runner is invoked (module path / `conftest.py`).
- **Why:** The testing agent wrote tests it couldn't execute (no shell), so import/path
  errors slipped through on every run and the reviewer (correctly) blocked them — PR #4
  (test/impl fail-safe mismatch) and PR #5 (`from app import …` module-path error). Same
  shape as the `git_diff` fix: give the agent the ability to verify its own output. This
  is real code execution in the CI sandbox — the capability expansion we'd deliberately
  deferred until now.

### 🔜 Backlog — consider `ldcli` for flag creation
- Today the implementer creates flags via the REST-backed `create_flag` tool. Using
  LaunchDarkly's official CLI (`ldcli`) may be more efficient/idiomatic long-term.
  Revisit once the core chain is stable. (https://launchdarkly.com/docs/home/getting-started/ldcli)
